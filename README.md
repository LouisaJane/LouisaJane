- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @LouisaJane, a postdoc at Reading University
- ðŸ‘€ I am passionate about neuroscience research in general, and also about research into autism which is conducted with input from autistic people. I love data, data analysis, and coding!
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more about open science practices, and how to apply different types of comutational models to data.

My PhD research (at Royal Holloway) focused on using a Bayesian approach to explore individual differences in reward processing and contagion of value preferences in neurotypical and autistic adults, using computational modelling and behavioural and fMRI studies.

In my new postdoc role I am also using computational modelling to explore sensory processing in autism.
